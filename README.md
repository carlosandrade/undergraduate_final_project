Some empirical results of my undergraduate final project is here. Under Dr. Rick Kazman, visiting researcher at the Software Engineering
Institute at Carnegie Mellon, I studied and used Glasser and Strauss Grounded Theory along 
with some data mining algorithms to make sense of software engineering effort in Open Source Communities.  

Feel free to reach me for more details.
